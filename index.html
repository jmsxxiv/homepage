    â€• Hello World! &#x1F609;

    <h3>Hi there! This is Jhem ðŸ‘‹ </h3>
        
        
        
        <p>As of now, while I am still on the process of learning, my home page is kinda boring.
        However, once I have learned enough, I will make it a point to improve my website.
        
        This is my stepping stone to become a developer, so I will make this as my comparison between when I started vs when I have learned!! Fighting!!
